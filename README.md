### Development

It's very easy to get started with these 3 steps:

* Clone this project to your local machine.
* Open terminal and `cd` into the cloned folder, usually `cd Manta`.
* Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
* Run `yarn dev` in one tab to start `webpack-dev-server`.
* Run `yarn start` in another tab to open the app.
